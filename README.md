# Code: A classification of social media comments based on controversial statement characteristics

This repository holds the code to my bachelor thesis for the study-program 
*Creative Computing*. The topic of the thesis was to identify features 
that represent if a social media comment is controversial or not. The given comments
are classified by these determined features.

# Experimental Setup
In the following the process for getting to the final result will be explained. To try the 
code yourself you would need to apply for the full DeTox-dataset and place it at `detox/DeTox-Dataset_complete.sqlite3`.

# Acknowledgements
The dataset used in this thesis is the [Detox](https://github.com/hdaSprachtechnologie/detox)-dataset 
which was presented in Demus et al. (2022, pp. 143â€“153).
