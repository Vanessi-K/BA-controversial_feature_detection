# Code: A classification of social media comments based on controversial statement characteristics

This repository holds the code to my bachelor thesis for the study-program 
*Creative Computing*. The topic of the thesis was to identify features 
that represent if a social media comment is controversial or not. The given comments
are classified by these determined features.

# Experimental Setup
In the following the process for getting to the final result will be explained. To try the 
code yourself you would need to apply for the full DeTox-dataset and place it at `detox/DeTox-Dataset_complete.sqlite3`.

## 01: Modify data structure
In a first step the given data-structure was transformed into a format appropriate for the use case.
For each comment that had a conversation-id assigned the next two comment-texts of the conversation are each added 
as a property to the comment. This is done to have a better overview of the conversation and to be able to evaluate
if the reactions to a comment are of a different opinion or not. The resulting data-structure is saved as a CSV-file.
The available columns in the end are:
- id
- c_id
- c_text
- date
- conv_id
- reaction1
- reaction2
